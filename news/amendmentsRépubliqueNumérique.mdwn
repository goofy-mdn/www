[[!meta title="In support of user data rights in France's République Numérique draft law"]]
[[!meta language="en"]]

The French government has launched a platform to solicit contributions
on its draft law « république numérique » (digital republic). A
section of the law would give rise to the recognition of user data
rights regarding “portability” of data.

Today, with La Quadrature du Net, we are adding our own amendment in
order to recognise users' <strong>right to know how their data is
stored</strong>. We think that when the data you use is stored online
by a specific provider, users should be informed about where that
specific service provider stores the data, <strong>how long, in which
jurisdiction</strong> the specific service provider operates, and
which laws apply.

You can join us and support this proposal: <https://www.republique-numerique.fr/consultations/projet-de-loi-numerique/consultation/consultation/opinions/section-2-portabilite-des-donnees/article-12-portabilite-des-donnees/versions/consacrer-un-droit-d-information-sur-les-modalites-du-stockage-des-fichiers-et-donnees-utilisateur>

In the User Data Manifesto, we also demand that users have the
<strong>freedom to choose a platform</strong>, i.e. users should
always be able to extract their data from the service at any time
without experiencing any vendor lock-in. Open standards for formats
and protocols are necessary to guarantee this.

Please support this amendment in order to make this user data right
more effective: <https://www.republique-numerique.fr/consultations/projet-de-loi-numerique/consultation/consultation/opinions/section-2-portabilite-des-donnees/article-12-portabilite-des-donnees/versions/consacrer-un-droit-effectif-a-la-portabilite>.

If you have other inspired ideas in line with the user data manifesto
that could be implemented into law, feel free to suggest them!
Contributions and votes are still accepted until the end of the week.
