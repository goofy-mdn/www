Today, the main authors of the User Data Manifesto have announced the release of version 2.0 during the [ownCloud Contributor Conference](https://owncloud.org/conf/) in Berlin.

> “The version 1.0 was instantly very popular and I got a ton of positive feedback and support. But over the time it also became clear that a few things could be expressed in a simpler and clearer way. So the idea came up to do a revision of the manifesto based on all the feedback” [says Frank Karlitschek](http://karlitschek.de/2015/08/user-data-manifesto-2-0-launched/) who launched the initiative in 2012.

> “The recognition of the User Data Rights defined in the manifesto is an important block to build a free society in the digital age“ [according to Hugo Roy](https://hroy.eu/posts/UserDataManifesto2dot0/), coauthor of the User Data Manifesto version 2.

The publication of the Manifesto is supported by:

The User Data Manifesto is a starting point, a humble contribution to the greater debate on rights and freedoms online that can hopefully help raise awareness.
