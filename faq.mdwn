 1. what’s the difference between *personal data* protection and *user data* rights?

    Data is called *personal data* when it identifies a person, called the
    *data subject*. But the data subject is not necessarily the user of the
    data.

    For example, if Alice uploads a very boring photo of her friend Bernard;
    the data of that photo is both *personal data* because it identifies
    Bernard (the *subject*), but it is also *user data* because it is Alice who
    uploaded the photo somwhere: she is the *user*.

 1. what’s *not* user data?

    User data is not necessarily private data and does not necessarily relate to a
    person or contains personally identifiable information. Thus, this manifesto
    does not aim at modifying personal data regulations, but rather aim at
    complementing them.

    Anonymously “dumped” data, e.g. on pastebin, or data that can be edited
    directly by anybody, e.g. a public etherpad, do not usually deal with user
    data.
