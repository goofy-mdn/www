This manifesto aims at defining users’ fundamental 
[[!taglink rights_to_their_own_data|datarights]] in the Internet age. People
ought to be free and should not have to pay allegiance to service providers. 

[[!toggle  id="userdata" text="""
<ol start="0"><li><p><strong>User data</strong> means any data uploaded by a
user for his or her own use.</p></li></ol>

Examples of user data include:

  - the files a user is syncing through multiple devices or sharing with a
    friend
  - a library of photos, books or other files a user uploads from their device
    in order to be able to read, view or modify online
  - data generated by a user's device (like a connected watch or
    theromstat) and sent to a server
  - a user's search engine queries, if they are logged as such 
"""]]

Thus, users should have:

1. **Control** over user data access

    [[!toggle  id="wucat" text="""
    User data should be under the ultimate control of the user. Users should be
    able to decide whom to grant direct access to their data and with which
    permissions and licenses such access should be granted.
    """]]

    [[!toggleable id="wucat" text="""
    [[!toggle  id="wucat" text="×"]]
    When users have control over the upload of their data, data
    intended to be privately shared should not be accessible to the
    service provider, nor shared with governments.

    That means the right to use [[!taglink cryptography]] should never be
    denied. 

    That also means that when users do not have full control over the upload of
    their data (e.g. if they don't use cryptography before uploading) a service
    provider should **not**:
     
     1. force users to disclose private data (including private correspondence)
        with them, nor
     2. impose licensing conditions (e.g. on copyright, or personal
        data exploitation) that go beyond what is necessary for the
        purpose of running the service.

    When users make data available to others, whether to a restrictive group of
    people or to large groups, they should be able to decide under which
    permissions they grant access to this data. However, this right is not
    absolute and should not extend over others’ rights to use and exploit the
    data once it has been made available to them.  What’s more, it does not
    mean that users should have the right to impose unfair restrictions to
    other people. In any event, technical systems should not be designed to
    enforce such restrictions (e.g. through [[!taglink DRM]]).
    """]]

    [[!toggle  id="ssauts" text="""
    Data generated or associated with user data (e.g. metadata) should also be
    made available to that user and put under their control just like the user
    data itself.
    """]]

    [[!toggleable id="ssauts" text="""
    [[!toggle  id="ssauts" text="×"]]
    Some services allow users to submit data with the intention to make it
    publicly available and usable by all. Even in these cases, some
    amount of user data is kept private (e.g. metadata or social graph
    data). The user should also have control over this data.
    """]]


2. **Knowledge** of how user data is stored

    [[!toggle  id="wuucstu" text="""
    When user data is uploaded to a specific service provider, users should be
    informed about the geographic location that specific service provider
    stores the data in, how long, in which jurisdiction that specific service
    provider operates and which laws apply.
    """]]

    [[!toggleable id="wuucstu" text="""
    [[!toggle  id="wuucstu" text="×"]]
    When users use centralised services that uploads data to specific storage
    providers instead of relying on peer-to-peer systems, it is important to
    know where the providers might store data because they could be compelled
    by governments to turn over data they have in their possession.
    """]]

    [[!toggle  id="usnroc" text="""
    This point is not relevant when users are able to store their own data on
    devices in their vicinity and under their direct control (e.g. servers) or
    when they rely on systems without centralised control (e.g. peer-to-peer).
    """]]


    [[!toggleable id="usnroc" text="""
    [[!toggle  id="usnroc" text="×"]]
    Users should not rely on centralised services. Peer-to-peer systems and
    unhosted applications are a means to that end.  In the long term, all users
    should be able to have their own server with
    [[!taglink Free_Software]].
    """]]

3. **Freedom** to choose a platform

    [[!toggle  id="usngsi" text="""
    Users should always be able to extract their data from the service at any
    time without experiencing any vendor lock-in.
    """]]

    [[!toggleable id="usngsi" text="""
    [[!toggle  id="usngsi" text="×"]]
    Users should not get stuck into a specific technical solution.  This is why
    they should always be able to leave a platform and settle elsewhere.

    [[!taglink Open_standards]] for formats and protocols are necessary to
    guarantee this.
    
    Obviously, without the source code of the programs used to deal with user
    data, this is impractical. This is why programs available to exploit
    exported data should be available under a 
    [[!taglink Free_Software_(Open_Source)_License|Free_Software]].
    """]]


If users have these rights, they are in control of their data rather than being
subjugated by service providers. 

Many services that deal with user data at the moment are gratis, but that does
not mean they are free (as in freedom). Instead of paying with money, users are
[[!taglink paying_with_their_allegiance|Internet_Feudalism]] to the service
providers so that they can exploit user data (e.g. by selling them, licensing
them or building a profile for advertisers). 

Surrendering privacy and other rights in this way may seem to many people a
trivial thing and a small price to pay for the sake of convenience that these
Internet services bring. 

Service providers have thus been unwittingly compelled to turn their valuable
Internet services into massive and centralised surveillance systems. It is of
grave importance that people understand and realize this, since it
forms a serious threat to the freedom of humanity and to the privacy
of each individual.


Ultimately, to ensure that user data is under the users’ control, the best
technical designs include peer-to-peer or distributed systems, and unhosted
applications. Legally, that means terms of service should respect users’ rights
and give them the possibility to exercise the [[!taglink datarights]] defined
in this manifesto.
