" > The manifesto as it stands, seems fine for \"user-created content\", as "
"in social media. But with the dawn of the Internet of Things, people will be "
"generating much data of which they are unaware, though often it will have "
"privacy implications. Therefore I propose a new section in the manifesto "
"which deals with anonymisation. Often the use of anonymous data will be "
"beneficial to citizens; they just need to have control of what is anonymised "
"and when. \n"
