  - [Franklin Street Statement on Freedom and Network Services][franklin]

    > The current generation of network services or Software as a Service can
    > provide advantages over traditional, locally installed software in ease of
    > deployment, collaboration, and data aggregation. Many users have begun to

  - [Open Software Service Definition][opendefinition]

    > An online service, also known under the title of Software as a Service
    > (SaaS), is a service provided by a software application running online and
    > making its facilities available to users over the Internet via an interface
    > (be that HTML presented by a web-browser such as Firefox, via a web-API or by
    > any other means).
    > 
    > With an online-service, in contrast to a traditional software application,
    > users no longer need to ‘possess’ (own or license) the software to use it.
    > Instead they can simply interact via a standard client (such as web-browser)
    > and pay, where they do pay, for use of the ‘service’ rather than for ‘owning’
    > (or licensing) the application itself.
